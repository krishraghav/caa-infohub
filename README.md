# üò∑ Protest Advisories

If you are hit by tear gas, remember the following (via Sarah Jeong):

- Cover your nose and mouth with a damp cloth. Particulates will stick to it, instead of your mucus membranes.
- A solution of 50/50 liquid antacid & water (LAW) can be used to rinse eyes.
- Make sure to rinse off in a cold shower when you get home. Heat can reactivate residue.
- Store garments that have been exposed in a plastic bag until you can launder them to keep contaminants contained.
- Try to keep calm, and regulate your breathing. Keep an eye out for anyone having an asthma attack.
- Walk briskly, don't run. Running increases your rate of respiration, & also your chances of injury to self & others.
- Carry basic first-aid and water
